# fine-grain-classification
This project tackles the challenge of fine-grained bird species classification using the CUB-200-2011 dataset, which contains 200 bird species. The solution employs transfer learning with EfficientNetB4, hyperparameter tuning, and phased training to balance accuracy and overfitting.
